## **Technologies Used**

The website is built using the following technologies:

### **1. Markup / Structure**

* **HTML5**

  * Provides the structure for all website sections including Skills, Certifications, Achievements, Projects, and Contact.
  * Utilizes semantic elements like `<section>`, `<div>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<form>`, and `<iframe>` for accessibility and organization.

### **2. Styling / Layout**

* **Tailwind CSS**

  * Utility-first framework for rapid and responsive styling.
  * Includes gradients, rounded corners, hover/focus effects, and responsive layouts (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` prefixes).
    
* **CSS Gradients**
  * Background gradients for skill cards, certifications, and achievements.
    
* **Custom Inline CSS**
  * Fallback styles for map overlays, scroll animations, and card effects.

### **3. Icons / Graphics**

* **FontAwesome**
  * Icons used for skills, certifications, achievements, contact information, and social media links.
    
* **Google Maps iframe**
  * Embedded interactive map for my location.

### **4. Interactivity / Behavior**

* **Vanilla JavaScript**
  * Navigation between sections with smooth scrolling.
  * Client-side form handling with validation and feedback.
  * Hover animations for skill icons.
  * Keyboard navigation for quick section switching (keys 1–9).

### **5. Backend / Server-Side Handling**

* Form submissions are handled on the client side and do not require a backend.

  * Serverless functions for lightweight backend functionality.

### **6. Performance & Accessibility**

* **Responsive Design**

* **Lazy Loading**
  * Google Maps iframe uses lazy loading for optimized performance.
    
* **Accessibility Features**
  * Keyboard navigation and focus states.
  * Smooth scrolling to enhance usability.

### **7. Animations / Effects**
